# Assignment 1 - Idea Pitch: "CoinTracker"

## Project Title
**CoinTracker**

## Project Overview
**CoinTracker** is a modern, user-friendly financial management application that helps users efficiently track their income, expenses, savings, and debts.  
It provides a clear overview of financial health through interactive charts and personalized dashboards.  
With **CoinTracker**, users can set savings goals, monitor budgets, manage debts, and even communicate with others about shared expenses — all in one place.

## Problem Statement
Many people find it difficult to keep track of their finances using spreadsheets or multiple apps.  
This often leads to missed payments, overspending, and lack of motivation to save.  
**CoinTracker** solves this by bringing everything together in one simple, visual, and engaging platform.

## Target Users
Individuals who want better control of their personal finances — especially young professionals, students, and anyone seeking to build healthy financial habits.

## Proposed Solution
A single, intuitive app that provides income and expense tracking, savings goal management, debt tracking, in-app messaging, and educational financial tips — helping users gain confidence in their money management.

## How the Idea Was Developed
The idea came from the team’s personal experience struggling to manage finances efficiently across multiple tools.  
**CoinTracker** was created to simplify that process and make financial management accessible for everyone.
